```{r import data}
# Read in tuition cost and diversity data from the data folder, then inner join them together
# and assign it to joined_data 

joined_data
```


```{r customize, include = FALSE}
my_state <- "FL" # can you make this a parameter?
diversity_my_state <- get_category_by_state(joined_data, my_state)
```

**Diversity Report: `r my_state`**

```{r table}
knitr::kable(diversity_my_state)
```

```{r plot}
plot_title <- glue::glue("State: {my_state}")
diversity_my_state %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = enrollment, y = category)) %>% 
  geom_col() %>% 
  ggtitle(label = plot_title)
